# RailFood: On-Track Food Delivery for Railway Passengers

## Description

RailFood is a unique platform designed to enhance the travel experience of railway passengers by enabling them to order food from their favorite restaurants in the cities their train is about to pass through. 
This project aims to revolutionize the traditional on-board catering system by providing a wider variety of food options, ensuring quality, and offering a seamless ordering and delivery experience.

RailFood provides a digital platform where passengers can view the train route, estimated arrival times at each station, and a list of partnered restaurants in those cities. 
Passengers can browse menus, place orders, and schedule deliveries to coincide with the train's arrival at a particular station.

By using RailFood, passengers can enjoy meals from a variety of cuisines and popular restaurants, rather than being limited to the often limited and less-than-satisfactory options available on the train. 
This not only enhances the travel experience but also supports local restaurants in the cities the train passes through.

In addition to the food ordering system, RailFood also includes a real-time tracking feature. Once an order is placed, passengers can track their order status and estimated delivery time, ensuring they can plan their meal times accordingly.

RailFood is not just a food delivery platform, but a movement towards a more enjoyable and satisfying travel experience. By connecting passengers with local restaurants, we can all contribute to a more diverse and enjoyable food culture.
